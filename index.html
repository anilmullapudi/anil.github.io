	<p>The main aim this thesis is to detect and classify human activities from time series data
which is collected from pressure sensors. To identify activities, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is trained using a modified BaumWelch
algorithm that allows for semi-supervised training using a set of labeled activity data as well as a
larger set of unlabeled pressure data in which activities have not been previously identified. The goal of
being able to classify these activities is to allow for general behavior monitoring and, paired with anomaly
detection approaches, to enhance the ability of the system to detect significant changes in behavior to
help identify warning signs for health changes in elderly individuals</p>
